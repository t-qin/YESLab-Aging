# YESLab-Aging Repository

Welcome to the YESLab aging project's repository! This repository is organized to facilitate easy access to and management of readings and materials related to the future aging study. Below is a guide on how to use and contribute to this repository:

## Repository Structure

- **Readings (Papers and Books)**: 
  - Papers and books are categorized and stored in respective folders.
  - Papers are placed in folders with their reviews/reports (if available) under the authors' names.
  - Different editions of a book are stored within the same folder.
  - Creating a README.md in each of these folders is encouraged for people to take notes. It is also encouraged to attach your name after your note.

- **Lab Members' Folders**:
  - Each lab member has a personal folder containing their materials (reading lists, presentations, etc.).
  - Lab members are encouraged to make frequent pull requests, ideally updating the reading lists as soon as an item is read or uploading a report/review once it is written, to ensure everyone is up-to-date.

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Adding Descriptions**: 
  - When adding new materials, please include a brief description. Detailed descriptions are not necessary.
  
- **Handling Complicated Issues**: 
  - For any complex problems or questions, please reach out to Tianhao Qin on Slack.

## Collaboration

This repository is a collaborative effort. We encourage all members to actively contribute and help build this resource together.

Thank you for your cooperation and happy reading!
