### Here are the image sets we looked at in early summer of 2024. 

- FGNet
    - This is the only useable image set we have found so far. Please see the folder named FGNet.

- MORPH
    - The MORPH dataset is one of the largest and most widely used publicly available longitudinal face databases.
    - There are two main versions of the MORPH dataset:
        - MORPH Album 1: This is a smaller, earlier version of the dataset.
        - MORPH Album 2: This version is the most commonly used and contains a significantly larger number of images and subjects.
    - The problem with this dataset is that all of the images contained in it are all mugshots and the MORPH dataset is a proprietary dataset and requires a licensing agreement to access.
        - But wierdly enough you can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chiragsaipanuganti/morphdata). 
    - The dataset primarily consists of facial images collected from law enforcement agencies, which is why they have a uniform, standardized look, with subjects facing forward and neutral expressions. The images were taken in controlled environments, typically as part of legal or criminal records, so the backgrounds, lighting, and poses are consistent. 

- UTK Faces
    - You can find their Github page [here](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/).
    - Only the in-wild-faces are downloadable, by clicking the other two you will see error 404.
    - [Conditional Adversarial Autoencoder(CAAE)](https://github.com/ZZUTK/Face-Aging-CAAE?tab=readme-ov-file)
        - This porject uses UTK Faces (The unaccessible alligned and cropped images). ~~We gave up on this one since it was hard to find alligned and cropped images.~~

- [Cross-Age Celebrity Dataset (CACD)](https://bcsiriuschen.github.io/CARC/)
